## Projects
1. [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/SUKHMAN-SINGH-1612/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Prediction)
   - **Description:** The project predicts the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) of the Breast Cancer
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Decision Tree Classification and Logistic Regression
   - **Results:** The logistic regression gave 97% accuracy and decision tree gave 93.5% accuracy
2. [Red Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/SUKHMAN-SINGH-1612/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Red%20Wine%20Quality)
   -  **Description:** The project predicts the quality of the wine in the value 0 or 1. 1 for good quality and 0 for bad quality
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and knn
   - **Results:** The logistic regression model performs the best with accuracy of 86.67%
